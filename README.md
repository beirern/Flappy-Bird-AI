# Flappy-Bird-AI
An AI for a custom made Flappy Bird Game!

## This is probably your most self explanitory title
Thank you!

## How to Use
This is an IntelliJ Idea project. I think you open up IntelliJ and import the project, I honestly don't know if it works any other way. If that works click play to run the project!

## There is no AI
I know. I have made the game, it is a little laggy. I really tried to add in AI. I made a MultiLayeredPerceptron using the Java Neuroph package and using Genetic Algorithms to train the AI through reinforcement learning. This would not work no matter how hard I tried. I am going to use a reinforcement learning approach.
